### Hi there 🦀

- 🔭 I’m currently curiously exploring the world of computer science and programming <br>
     which always sparked my interest, but for the last year I am actively acquiring as much knowledge as my brain can muster. <br>
     
- 👾 I am working on my first Python Projects, <br> 
     where I dive into my enjoyment of puzzles by piecing together my coding knowledge to create logicgames.

- 💡 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript and Go on boot.dev and am on the learning path to become a backend developer.

- 📚 Previously I completed two Python certifications in self-paced online courses by the University of Michigan.
